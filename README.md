AVA-AI.BCC – Price Predictor App
A basic AI-powered price predictor application built using Python, designed to predict prices based on user input and trained data. This app is command-line based and built with concepts learned from the Internshala Online C Programming Course, later enhanced with Python and machine learning modules.

----- Features
1. Predicts prices using trained machine learning models
2. Compares predicted vs actual prices
3. Runs directly in Command Prompt/Terminal
4. Modular and easy to modify for new datasets
5. In development: Real-time price graph & auto-refresh functionality
